# version management

Each command creates a new file containing only the objects that have changed. This could allow the query engine to have access to older versions of data.
All we need to do is create a hidden property on each object which points to the previous version. To build this, the load-worker should just load all 
  data files and return those instead of re-serializing the latest data. The meta.resultArray should still contain only references to the latest versions
  of each object. The meta.index.id should likewise only index the latest versions.
In addition you should be able to ask each object what its version is. That should return the command id of the command that altered it, or null.
